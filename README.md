# C++ Modules - 42 School

This repository contains my solutions to the C++ modules from the 42 School Common Core curriculum. These modules provide a comprehensive introduction to C++ programming, covering fundamental concepts from basic syntax to advanced object-oriented programming principles.

## 📚 Modules Overview

### ✅ [CPP Module 00](./CPP_00) - Introduction to C++
Introduction to C++ basics, including namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, and const.

**Topics covered:**
- Namespaces and classes
- Member attributes and functions
- I/O streams (`std::cout`, `std::cin`)
- Encapsulation (public/private)
- References and const correctness

**Exercises:**
- **ex00**: Megaphone - String manipulation and I/O
- **ex01**: PhoneBook - First OOP project with classes

---

### ✅ [CPP Module 01](./CPP_01) - Memory Allocation and References
Deep dive into memory management, pointers, references, and understanding the differences between stack and heap allocation.

**Topics covered:**
- Memory allocation (`new`/`delete`)
- Stack vs Heap
- Pointers vs References
- Pointers to member functions
- File I/O and string manipulation

**Exercises:**
- **ex00**: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ - Stack vs Heap allocation
- **ex01**: Moar Brainz! - Array allocation
- **ex02**: HI THIS IS BRAIN - Pointers and references
- **ex03**: Unnecessary Violence - References vs pointers in class design
- **ex04**: Sed is for Losers - File manipulation
- **ex05**: Harl 2.0 - Pointers to member functions

## 🛠️ Compilation

All modules are compiled with **C++98 standard** using:
```bash
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98
```

Each module and exercise contains its own `Makefile` for easy compilation:
```bash
cd CPP_XX/exXX
make
```

## 📖 Resources

Learning C++ through these modules involves understanding:
- The transition from C to C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Memory management and RAII
- Operator overloading and polymorphism
- Templates and STL (Standard Template Library)

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

These modules aim to teach:
1. **Fundamentals**: Basic C++ syntax and features
2. **OOP**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
3. **Memory**: Proper memory management and resource handling
4. **Best Practices**: Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable C++ code
